###### A status page tool 

## ðŸš§ Under Construction ðŸš§

This repo is currently under development. Help is always welcome! If you're looking to get started file an issue!

## What it does

It's a status page tool with the ability to understand relationships. That means when a dependency has a problem the 
downstream systems will indicate the problem as well! Very handy for microservices.

## Why it exists

I got tired of being frustrated by other tools and always having to half implement a good system because whoever didn't 
feel comfortable integrating too tightly to the cloud.
